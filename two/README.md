I sent an e-mail to M. Sthepane Gaiffas who authorized me to deliver this homework late because i caught COVID and I couldn't
work nor go to college for more than a week.

I inspired myself from a git repo and his author's other works to answer the question 10 and 11 on Lorenz curves and Gini index:

### Hi Oussama, I hope you are recovering well. I have a question concerning your work. In your response to Prof. St√©phane google doc, you have MUSAFARI Divid as your partner. I found another different repository in that google doc (https://github.com/GameChangerMT/Big-Data-Technologies-Course). Now, you invite me to this repo. Can you tell me which is the one you want me to grade? Thanks.

### Best,
### Sothea
